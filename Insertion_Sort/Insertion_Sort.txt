1. Insertion Sort

Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works similarly

// to the way you sort playing cards in your hands. The array is virtually split

into a sorted and an unsorted part. Values from the unsorted part are picked and 
 placed at the correct position in the sorted part.
 Insertion sort is fast and best.

suitable either when the problem size is small (because it has low overhead) or when

the data is nearly sorted (because it is adaptive).

- Insertion sort is an algorithm to sort an array of elements
- The algorithm works by continually looking at the next element in the right-hand side of the list

[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz7vBodZqo8&t=43) Sorting a list by continually shifting elements
- Elements are shifted until they are in the right position on the left side of the list
- Continuously inserting the right element into the right position in the list

[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz7vBodZqo8&t=83) Implementing insertion sort algorithm in C
- Create an array of 8 elements
 - Write a function to accept array and its length as arguments

[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz7vBodZqo8&t=128) Sorting algorithm using two loops
- Outer loop looks at each element in the array one at a time
- Inner loop shifts the element over to the right position in the left-hand portion of the array

[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz7vBodZqo8&t=171) Sorting algorithm with shifting
- The algorithm shifts elements to place them in the correct position
- It uses nested loops to compare and shift elements

[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz7vBodZqo8&t=215) Insertion sort algorithm explained
- Compares each element with the key and shifts elements to make space for the key
- Continues until the key is placed in its correct position

[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz7vBodZqo8&t=267) Insertion sort algorithm explained
- Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works the way we sort playing cards in our hands.
- The algorithm iterates through the array and compares each element with the previous ones to find the correct position for the element.

[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz7vBodZqo8&t=309) Implementation of insertion sort in C
- Code uses a loop to print elements of the array in a formatted way
