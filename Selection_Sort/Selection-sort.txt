2. Selection Sort

The selection sort algorithm is a way of organizing a list of items.
 It works by repeatedly finding the smallest item in the unorganized
  part of the list and moving it to the beginning. The algorithm divides
   the list into two parts:

1. The part that is already sorted.
2. The part that is still unsorted.

In each iteration or round of selection sort,
we find the smallest item from the unsorted part of the list and place it in the sorted part.
This process continues until the entire list is sorted. 
One advantage of selection sort is that it minimizes the number of swaps needed to sort the list.
This makes it a good choice when swapping items is expensive or time-consuming.
